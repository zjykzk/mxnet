# Symbol - Neural network graphs and auto-differentiation

Besides the tensor computation interface `NDArray`, another main object in MXNet
is the `Symbol` provided by `mxnet.symbol`, or `mxnet.sym` for short. A symbol
represents a multi-output symbolic expression. They are composited by operators,
such as simple matrix operations (e.g. "+"), or a neural network layer
(e.g. convolution layer). An operator can take several input variables, produce
more than one output variables, and have internal state variables. A variable
can be either free, which we can bind with value later, or an output of another
symbol.

## Symbol Composition

### Basic Operators

The following example composites a simple expression `a+b`. We first create the
placeholders `a` and `b` with names using `mx.sym.Variable`, and then construct
the desired symbol by using the operator `+`. When the string name is not given
during creating, MXNet will automatically generate a unique name for the symbol,
which is the case for `c`.

```python
import mxnet as mx
a = mx.sym.Variable('a')
b = mx.sym.Variable('b')
c = a + b
(a, b, c)
```

Most `NDArray` operators can be applied to `Symbol`, for example:

```python
# elemental wise times
d = a * b
# matrix multiplication
e = mx.sym.dot(a, b)
# reshape
f = mx.sym.reshape(d+e, shape=(1,4))
# broadcast
g = mx.sym.broadcast_to(f, shape=(2,4))
mx.viz.plot_network(symbol=g)
```

### Basic Neural Networks

Besides the basic operators, `Symbol` has a rich set of neural network
layers. The following codes construct a two layer fully connected neural work
and then visualize the structure by given the input data shape.

```python
net = mx.sym.Variable('data')
net = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=net, name='fc1', num_hidden=128)
net = mx.sym.Activation(data=net, name='relu1', act_type="relu")
net = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=net, name='fc2', num_hidden=10)
net = mx.sym.SoftmaxOutput(data=net, name='out')
mx.viz.plot_network(net, shape={'data':(100,200)})
```

### Modulelized Construction for Deep Networks

For deep networks, such as the Google Inception, constructing layer by layer is
painful given the large number of layers. For these networks, we often
modularize the construction. Take the Google Inception as an example, we can
first define a factory function to chain the convolution layer, batch
normalization layer, and Relu activation layer together:

```python
def ConvFactory(data, num_filter, kernel, stride=(1,1), pad=(0, 0), name=None, suffix=''):
    conv = mx.sym.Convolution(data=data, num_filter=num_filter, kernel=kernel, stride=stride, pad=pad, name='conv_%s%s' %(name, suffix))
    bn = mx.sym.BatchNorm(data=conv, name='bn_%s%s' %(name, suffix))
    act = mx.sym.Activation(data=bn, act_type='relu', name='relu_%s%s' %(name, suffix))
    return act
prev = mx.sym.Variable(name="Previous Output")
conv_comp = ConvFactory(data=prev, num_filter=64, kernel=(7,7), stride=(2, 2))
shape = {"Previous Output" : (128, 3, 28, 28)}
mx.viz.plot_network(symbol=conv_comp, shape=shape)
```

Then we define a function that constructs an Inception module based on
`ConvFactory`

```python
def InceptionFactoryA(data, num_1x1, num_3x3red, num_3x3, num_d3x3red, num_d3x3, pool, proj, name):
    # 1x1
    c1x1 = ConvFactory(data=data, num_filter=num_1x1, kernel=(1, 1), name=('%s_1x1' % name))
    # 3x3 reduce + 3x3
    c3x3r = ConvFactory(data=data, num_filter=num_3x3red, kernel=(1, 1), name=('%s_3x3' % name), suffix='_reduce')
    c3x3 = ConvFactory(data=c3x3r, num_filter=num_3x3, kernel=(3, 3), pad=(1, 1), name=('%s_3x3' % name))
    # double 3x3 reduce + double 3x3
    cd3x3r = ConvFactory(data=data, num_filter=num_d3x3red, kernel=(1, 1), name=('%s_double_3x3' % name), suffix='_reduce')
    cd3x3 = ConvFactory(data=cd3x3r, num_filter=num_d3x3, kernel=(3, 3), pad=(1, 1), name=('%s_double_3x3_0' % name))
    cd3x3 = ConvFactory(data=cd3x3, num_filter=num_d3x3, kernel=(3, 3), pad=(1, 1), name=('%s_double_3x3_1' % name))
    # pool + proj
    pooling = mx.sym.Pooling(data=data, kernel=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), pad=(1, 1), pool_type=pool, name=('%s_pool_%s_pool' % (pool, name)))
    cproj = ConvFactory(data=pooling, num_filter=proj, kernel=(1, 1), name=('%s_proj' %  name))
    # concat
    concat = mx.sym.Concat(*[c1x1, c3x3, cd3x3, cproj], name='ch_concat_%s_chconcat' % name)
    return concat
prev = mx.sym.Variable(name="Previous Output")
in3a = InceptionFactoryA(prev, 64, 64, 64, 64, 96, "avg", 32, name="in3a")
mx.viz.plot_network(symbol=in3a, shape=shape)
```

Finally we can obtain the whole network by chaining multiple inception
modulas. See a complete example at
[here](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/symbols/inception-bn.py).

### Group Multiple Symbols

To construct neural networks with multiple loss layers, we can use
`mxnet.sym.Group` to group multiple symbols together. The following example
group two outputs:

```python
net = mx.sym.Variable('data')
fc1 = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=net, name='fc1', num_hidden=128)
net = mx.sym.Activation(data=fc1, name='relu1', act_type="relu")
out1 = mx.sym.SoftmaxOutput(data=net, name='softmax')
out2 = mx.sym.LinearRegressionOutput(data=net, name='regression')
group = mx.sym.Group([out1, out2])
group.list_outputs()
```

## Relations to NDArray

As can be seen now, both Symbol and NDArray provide multi-dimensional array
operations, such as `c=a+b` in MXNet. We briefly clarify the difference here.

The `NDArray` provides an imperative programming alike interface, in which the
computations are evaluated sentence by sentence. While `Symbol` is closer to
declarative programming, in which we first declare the computation, and then
evaluate with data. Examples in this category include regular expression and
SQL.

The pros for `NDArray`:

- straightforward
- easy to work with other language features (for loop, if-else condition, ..)
  and libraries (numpy, ..)
- easy to step-by-step debug

The pros for `Symbol`:

- provides almost all functionalities of NDArray, such as +, \*, sin, and
  reshape
- provides a large number of neural network related operators such as
  Convolution, Activation, and BatchNorm
- provides automatic differentiation
- easy to construct and manipulate complex computations such as deep neural
  networks
- easy to save, load, and visualization
- easy for the backend to optimize the computation and memory usage

## Symbol Manipulation

One important difference of `Symbol` comparing to `NDArray` is that, we first
declare the computation, and then bind with data to run.

In this section we introduce the functions to manipulate a symbol directly. But
note that, most of them are wrapped nicely by the
`module` package. One can skip this section safely.

### Shape Inference

For each symbol, we can query its inputs (or arguments) and outputs. We can also
inference the output shape by given the input shape, which facilitates memory
allocation.


```python
arg_name = c.list_arguments()  # get the names of the inputs
out_name = c.list_outputs()    # get the names of the outputs
arg_shape, out_shape, _ = c.infer_shape(a=(2,3), b=(2,3))
{'input' : dict(zip(arg_name, arg_shape)),
 'output' : dict(zip(out_name, out_shape))}
```

### Bind with Data and Evaluate

The symbol `c` we constructed declares what computation should be run. To
evaluate it, we need to feed arguments, namely free variables, with data
first. We can do it by using the `bind` method, which accepts device context and
a `dict` mapping free variable names to `NDArray`s as arguments and returns an
executor. The executor provides method `forward` for evaluation and attribute
`outputs` to get all results.

```python
ex = c.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args={'a' : mx.nd.ones([2,3]),
                                'b' : mx.nd.ones([2,3])})
ex.forward()
print 'number of outputs = %d\nthe first output = \n%s' % (
           len(ex.outputs), ex.outputs[0].asnumpy())
```

We can evaluate the same symbol on GPU with different data

```python
ex_gpu = c.bind(ctx=mx.gpu(), args={'a' : mx.nd.ones([3,4], mx.gpu())*2,
                                    'b' : mx.nd.ones([3,4], mx.gpu())*3})
ex_gpu.forward()
ex_gpu.outputs[0].asnumpy()
```

### Load and Save

Similar to NDArray, we can either serialize a `Symbol` object by using `pickle`,
or use `save` and `load` directly. Different to the binary format chosen by
`NDArray`, `Symbol` uses the more readable json format for serialization. The
`tojson` method returns the json string.

```python
print(c.tojson())
c.save('symbol-c.json')
c2 = mx.sym.load('symbol-c.json')
c.tojson() == c2.tojson()
```

## Customized Symbol

Most operators such as `mx.sym.Convolution` and `mx.sym.Reshape` are implemented
in C++ for better performance. MXNet also allows users to write new operators
using any frontend language such as Python. It often makes the developing and
debugging much easier.

To implement an operator in Python, we just need to define the two computation
methods `forward` and `backward` with several methods for querying the
properties, such as `list_arguments` and `infer_shape`.

`NDArray` is the default type of arguments in both `forward` and
`backward`. Therefore we often also implement the computation with `NDArray`
operations. To show the flexibility of MXNet, however, we will demonstrate an
implementation of the `softmax` layer using NumPy. Though a NumPy based operator
can be only run on CPU and also lose some optimizations which can be applied on
NDArray, it enjoys the rich functionalities provided by NumPy.

We first create a subclass of `mx.operator.CustomOp` and then define `forward`
and `backward`.

```python
class Softmax(mx.operator.CustomOp):
    def forward(self, is_train, req, in_data, out_data, aux):
        x = in_data[0].asnumpy()
        y = np.exp(x - x.max(axis=1).reshape((x.shape[0], 1)))
        y /= y.sum(axis=1).reshape((x.shape[0], 1))
        self.assign(out_data[0], req[0], mx.nd.array(y))

    def backward(self, req, out_grad, in_data, out_data, in_grad, aux):
        l = in_data[1].asnumpy().ravel().astype(np.int)
        y = out_data[0].asnumpy()
        y[np.arange(l.shape[0]), l] -= 1.0
        self.assign(in_grad[0], req[0], mx.nd.array(y))
```

Here we use `asnumpy` to convert the `NDArray` inputs into `numpy.ndarray`. Then
using `CustomOp.assign` to assign the results back to `mxnet.NDArray` based on
the value of req, which could be "over write" or "add to".

Next we create a subclass of `mx.operator.CustomOpProp` for querying the
properties.

```python
# register this operator into MXNet by name "softmax"
@mx.operator.register("softmax")
class SoftmaxProp(mx.operator.CustomOpProp):
    def __init__(self):
        # softmax is a loss layer so we don't need gradient input
        # from layers above.
        super(SoftmaxProp, self).__init__(need_top_grad=False)

    def list_arguments(self):
        return ['data', 'label']

    def list_outputs(self):
        return ['output']

    def infer_shape(self, in_shape):
        data_shape = in_shape[0]
        label_shape = (in_shape[0][0],)
        output_shape = in_shape[0]
        return [data_shape, label_shape], [output_shape], []

    def create_operator(self, ctx, shapes, dtypes):
        return Softmax()
```

Finally, we can use `mx.sym.Custom` with the register name to use this operator

```python
net = mx.sym.Custom(data=prev_input, op_type='softmax')
```

## Advanced Usages

### Type Cast

MXNet uses 32-bit float in default. Sometimes we want to use a lower precision
data type for better accuracy-performance trade-off. For example, The Nvidia
Tesla Pascal GPUs (e.g. P100) have improved 16-bit float performance, while GTX
Pascal GPUs (e.g. GTX 1080) are fast on 8-bit integers.

We can use the `mx.sym.Cast` operator to convert the data type.

```python
a = mx.sym.Variable('data')
b = mx.sym.Cast(data=a, dtype='float16')
arg, out, _ = b.infer_type(data='float32')
print({'input':arg, 'output':out})

c = mx.sym.Cast(data=a, dtype='uint8')
arg, out, _ = c.infer_type(data='int32')
print({'input':arg, 'output':out})
```

### Variable Sharing

Sometimes we want to share the contents between several symbols. This can be
simply done by bind these symbols with the same array.

```python
a = mx.sym.Variable('a')
b = mx.sym.Variable('b')
c = mx.sym.Variable('c')
d = a + b * c

data = mx.nd.ones((2,3))*2
ex = d.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args={'a':data, 'b':data, 'c':data})
ex.forward()
ex.outputs[0].asnumpy()
```
